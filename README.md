BeerMe
======

This is my first Android App for counting large and small beer at a pub.

Functionality
-------------

This app  shall contain three Buttons:
+ add large beer
+ add small beer
+ undo last action

This App is designed to replace the common coaster. Therefore the design shall be very simple but also fancy and fun to use. The only purpose of this app shall be the counting of large and small beer, no calculations or any other fancy stuff.
